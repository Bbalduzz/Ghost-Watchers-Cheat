### How to run
As for now I haven't made an injector, so a monoinjector is needed.
1. Download **"GhostWatchersESP.dll"**
2. Download a **monoinjector** (I use [SharpMonoInjector](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=34970))
3. **Run** Ghost Watchers
4. **Run** SharpMonoInjector (smi_gui.exe)
5. In the Injector click refresh
6. Select the path of the downoaded GhostWatchersESP.dll
7. Set: `Class Name` = `Loader`
8. Set: `Method Name` = `Init`
9. Click Inject

### Note
- The code needs a in-depth clean up and optimization (too lazy to do it)
- This project is still under developement, i'm working to add new things
- This is my very first project done in c#, there's gonna be **a lot** of errors/bugs/things that could be improved
