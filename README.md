### How to run
As for now I haven't made an injector, so a monoinjector is needed.
1. Download **"GhostWatchersESP.dll"**
2. Download a **monoinjector** (I use [SharpMonoInjector](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/unity/408878-sharpmonoinjector-fixed-updated.html))
3. **Run** Ghost Watchers
4. **Run** SharpMonoInjector (smi_gui.exe)
5. In the Injector click refresh
6. Select the path of the downoaded GhostWatchersESP.dll
7. Set: `Class Name` = `Loader`
8. Set: `Method Name` = `Init`
9. Click Inject
